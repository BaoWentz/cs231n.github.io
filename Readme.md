### Tutorial for Google Colaboratory

If you choose to work with Google Colab, please watch the workflow tutorial above or read the instructions below.

1.Unzip the starter code zip file. You should see an `assignment1` folder.

2.Create a folder in your personal Google Drive and upload `assignment1/` folder to the Drive folder. We recommend that you call the Google Drive folder `cs231n/assignments/` so that the final uploaded folder has the path `cs231n/assignments/assignment1/`.

3.Each Colab notebook (i.e. files ending in `.ipynb`) corresponds to an assignment question. In Google Drive, double click on the notebook and select the option to open with `Colab`.

4.You will be connected to a Colab VM. You can mount your Google Drive and access your uploaded files by executing the first cell in the notebook. It will prompt you for an authorization code which you can obtain from a popup window. The code cell will also automatically download the CIFAR-10 dataset for you.

5.Once you have completed the assignment question (i.e. reached the end of the notebook), you can save your edited files back to your Drive and move on to the next question. For your convenience, we also provide you with a code cell (the very last one) that automatically saves the modified files for that question back to your Drive.

6.Repeat steps 3-5 for each remaining notebook.
